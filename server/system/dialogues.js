			text: "Good question. That's where Agile project management tools and processes come in. We can use tools like Kanban boards and daily stand-up meetings to keep track of our progress and make sure everyone is on the same page. It is important to note here that you decide what tools you want to use and customize how you prefer to use it.",

			text: "Our first step is to meet with the customer and get to know what project they are proposing. From there, we'll break down the project into smaller tasks and start working on them. But remember, communication and collaboration are key to Agile, so we'll be checking in with each other and the customer regularly to make sure we're on track. Are you ready to start?",
